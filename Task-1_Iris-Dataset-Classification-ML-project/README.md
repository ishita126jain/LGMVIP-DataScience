# Task-1-Iris-Dataset-Classification-ML-project
The Iris dataset is a famous dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used as a benchmark for classification models. It was first introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The goal of the Iris dataset ML project is to build a model that can accurately classify iris flowers into their respective species based on their four features. This is a classic example of a supervised classification problem in machine learning.

Here are the steps of the Iris dataset classification ML project:

1.Load the dataset: Load the Iris dataset into your Python environment using a library like Scikit-learn or Pandas.

2.Explore the dataset: Understand the dataset by analyzing its features and their distributions. You can use visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to create histograms, scatter plots, or box plots.

3.Preprocess the data: Prepare the data by cleaning, transforming, and normalizing it. This may involve removing missing values, scaling the data, or encoding categorical variables.

4.Split the data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using a library like Scikit-learn. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

5.Choose and train the model: Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the classification task, and train the model using the training data. Some popular algorithms for the Iris dataset include decision trees, SVMs, KNN, and logistic regression.

6.Evaluate the model: Use the testing set to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure its effectiveness.
